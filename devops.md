## Devops

As a cloud environment I would use AWS. We can create a Rest API with the Amazon API Gateway, configure the three endpoints and as this is not a complicated project we can use Lambda functions for our endpoints. We can also use the Amazon DynamoDB to store the associations between the file names and the hashes, and we can also use S3 buckets to store the created files.
